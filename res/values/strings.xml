    <string name="android1">Before I started my final year project in college the only thing I knew about Android was that its icon was green. I started the development of a native application for mobile devices for an existing project about online stores to get into the mobile development environment.</string>
    <string name="android2">The idea seemed easy at first but the full project took me almost a year, including an exhaustive and deep documentation of it that allowed me to know the platform in detail. The grade I obtained, first class with distinction, was a huge joy for me and a fair reward.</string>
    <string name="android3">Thanks to all the effort, I started working in Kernet, where I kept on expanding my knowledge and using all I had learnt. A lot of refactoring, code reusing and debugging, with great supervision made me able to be in charge of projects on my own in less than three months.</string>
    <string name="android4">Despite not having developed apps for clients in more than one year, I try to keep myself up to date with the news and latest features of Android. I think it will be the main mobile OS for a while, although I\'m eager to learn about other platforms.</string>
    <string name="desarrollo1">I\'ve been interested in web development since the first time I accessed the internet. I created my first website in the year 2000, I started learning on my own about the coolest web solutions at that time such as frames or flash. The first CMS that were coming, like PHPNuke seemed really useful at that time and boosted my PHP knowledge.</string>
    <string name="desarrollo2">When I started college I focused on client-server applications. It wasn\'t until the last years of my degree that i got access to lectures and courses on new frameworks and different programming languages like Struts, Symfony or Ruby on Rails.</string>
    <string name="desarrollo3">I think web development is one of my key points. Although I haven\'t worked in many professional projects, I know most of the tools used and the trends of the industry and I\'m really good at adapting to new environments and languages.</string>
    <string name="ingles">English</string>
    <string name="frances">French</string>
    <string name="espanol">Spanish</string>
    <string name="nativo">Native</string>
    <string name="oral_bajo">Oral: Low</string>
    <string name="escrito_medio">Written: Medium</string>
    <string name="oral_alto">Oral: Very High</string>
    <string name="escrito_alto">Written: Very High</string>
    <string name="ingles1">Although I don\'t have any official exams or qualifications I have an almost bilingual level of English. All the documentation I use is in English and if I have to google something I obviously do it in this language.</string>
    <string name="ingles2">Living in Canada for more than one year has been a great experience in this matter. I\'ve learnt a less academic language through daily use, but also I had the chance to express myself in a more professional and technical level thanks to being in charge of the IT department of the office.</string>
